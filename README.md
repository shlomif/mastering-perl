# About

This repository used to contain the previously publicly available sources and
Git history of brian d foy’s book
[Mastering Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_Perl) . The history
of the repository was nullified per request from the author -
https://github.com/shlomif/mastering-perl/issues/1 .

I will hopefully add more information and links about all that soon.

## Thanks

Thanks to RichiH from #git on Freenode for giving me advice on how to
nullify/reset the history of a remote git repository:

```
    «RichiH» rindolf: create a new repo, write a short README or just anything, add & commit that README, configure the remote, git push -f
```
